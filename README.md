## Features Left to Implement
•	An online section where an interested user anywhere in the world can register, pay and be trained through any online platform.

## Testing
•	I confirmed that the navigational bar, the home, club-photos and the register pages are readable and easy to understand.

•	I confirmed that the Gym Exercise site is responsive and looks good in standard different screen sizes.

•	The register form works very well. It requires entries in every field. In email label, it only accepts email address and the submit button works.

## Unfixed bugs
I could not fix the error because it is a column-count problem. The validator demands a unit should be added to the column count but column count which was added to the media queries has no unit.
